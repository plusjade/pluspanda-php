<div class="faq-page">
  <h3>1. So this works on my own website?</h3>
  <div>
  Yes, PlusPanda uses a small javascript file to dynamically and remotely
  load your entire testimonial environment.
  
  You just need 2 lines of code which are provided for you in the admin panel.
  Put the code wherever you want your testimonials to go and everything runs transparently on that page.
  </div>

  <h3>2. I already have a testimonial page, why change?</h3>
  <div>
    If you have a manually created testimonials page, chances are there is no
    easy way to update or add testimonials. It might be hard to sort or add category tags
    to them as well. Most testimonial pages are static and non-interactive. 
    Pluspanda also has/will have professionally designed templates and cross-browser interactions
    so your content is viewed in the best light.
    
    <br/>Pluspanda makes all of these features wonderfully easy to implement and <em>automatic</em> to maintain.

  <h3>3. What about a server-side API?</h3>
  <div>
    Rest assured a server-side api is in the works. 
    Utilizing the server-side api would maintain the exact same functionality
    and would ultimately be the ideal choice since your content would be generated
    organically, improving search engine visibility.
