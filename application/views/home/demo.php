		PlusPanda works like a widget. Just add a piece of custom code wherever you want your reviews to appear and that's it!
		
		<br/><br/>Sample Code:<br/>
		<textarea style="width:99%; height:100px; border:1px solid #777; background:#ffffcc;font-size:0.9em">&lt;div id="plusPandaYes"&gt;&lt;a href="http://jade.pluspanda.com"&gt;View Our Customer Reviews!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://test.panda.com/admin/js/widget" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</textarea>
	</div>
	
	<h6>Customers Never Leave Your Site.</h6>
	<div>
		Your branding is important. Customers can navigate <em>all</em>
		your reviews, sort by date and ratings, and even add their own review
		all without ever leaving your page. Try it!!
	</div>
	
	<h6>Specify Multiple Categories.</h6>
	<div>
		Multiple categories allows you to enable your customers
		 to review specific aspects of your business
		like delivery time, service, or price. Or perhaps
		you are a hair salon who wants customers to be able to review
		their stylists specifically. 
	</div>
	
	<h6>Automatic Review Moderation.</h6>
	<div>
		Owners <b>cannot</b> arbitrarily remove any reviews!
		Instead, malicious reviews can easily be "flagged" from your admin
		panel, and after a short moderation process may be removed.
		<a href="#">Read more about our moderation policy</a>.
	</div>
	
	<h6>Publicly Respond To Poor Reviews.</h6>
	<div>
		We know some owners might be hesitant to allow <em>poor</em> reviews
		to be seen on their own website. However, committing to an open, honest communication
		platform actually <em>increases</em> trust and loyalty.
		Your customers are intelligent. Let them see how you handle yourself
		through good and bad.
