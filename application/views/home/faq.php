<div class="faq-page">
	<h3>1. So This Works On My Own Website?</h3>
	<div>
	Yes, it can run entirely within your own website. 
	You just need 2 lines of code which are provided for you in the admin panel.
	Put the code wherever you want your reviews to go and everything runs transparently on that page.
	</div>

	<h3>2. What If I Don't Have a Website?</h3>
	<div>
	Technically you can use Pluspanda as a complete standalone version.
	Just go to your account url : username.pluspanda.com
	<br/>You can also create a website in minutes using <a href="http://weebly.com">Weebly.com</a>
	and then easily stick your pluspanda code on a page.
	</div>

	<h3>3. Can Owners Remove Bad Reviews?</h3>
	<div>
	Owners do NOT have the power to arbitrarily remove any reviews.
	<br/>
	One of pluspanda's main purposes is to establish
	a positive reputation for your business. It is a natural
	tendency for owners to want to filter out everything
	other than a spectacular review.
	However in order for customers to trust your reviews and your company,
	there needs to be an assurance of transparency and 3rd party
	validation. Having a full un-skewed picture shows you are upfront and open,
	and for the most part, customers understand nobody is perfect.
	</div>

	<h3>4. Shouldn't I be able to Manage My Reviews However I Want?</h3>
	<div>
	Yes, that's why we are building Pluspanda. Your reviews are part of <em>your</em>
	reputation. So they should be branded as such. 
	<br/>
	However No, in the sense that your customers deserve to know
	the reviews are an <em>honest</em> representation of what your customers are saying about your business.
	Allowing owners to arbitrarily remove reviews is not in alignment with an open and honest feedback policy.
	</div>

	<h3>5. How Do I Handle Malicious Reviews?</h3>
	<div>
	If you believe a review to have clearly malicious intent, you are encouraged to "Flag" the review.
	Flagging a review immediately removes it from the general stats and filters/sorters.
	Instead it can be viewed under "flagged". 
	An email is sent to the reviewer to verify an actual human being wrote the review
	and to confirm their concerns are legitimate.
	Unconfirmed reviews, and reviews with explicit language are then completely removed from the system.
	Reviews that are confirmed, even if you believe them to be
	clearly unfounded, will return to the system.
	However you can then respond publicly to the review to give your side of the story, provide a solution
	or convey an apology - whatever you feel best reflects the proper course of action.

	<h3>6. Don't Poor Reviews Hurt My Reputation?</h3>
	<div>
		<em>Consistently</em> poor reviews hurt your reputation.
		Your customers are intelligent. They understand that businesses cannot possibly
		please everbody, that things go wrong from time to time, and what matters is not
		what happend exactly to one person at one given point in time,
		but how your business as a whole conducts itself day in and day out.
