Pluspanda is a service that collects and displays testimonials. --
As of 1 July, 2010 this codebase runs http://pluspanda.com

DOCUMENTATION:
-----------------------------
This original version is based on the kohana php framework v2.3.4
http://kohanaframework.org/download
Kohana is a PHP5 MVC framework that takes much inspiration from rails.
Please read the docs at kohana to understand pluspanda.
Pluspanda uses Javascript and JSONP to display data.


GOALS:
-----------------------------
Pluspanda is intended to be a "widget service" allowing
users to collect testimonials from their customers, manage them
from a central interface, and then display them in various ways
across varying sites through plugins, primarily with javascript.



FUTURE:
-----------------------------
Pluspanda is being recoded in ruby on rails.
There will NOT be any more improvements to this version of pluspanda.

RoR makes it easier to build a RESTful service based heavily on JSON outputs
which is conveniently exactly what pluspanda is intended to do.

Going with RoR aligns with the vision I have for making 
easy api services for specific, simple tasks.
