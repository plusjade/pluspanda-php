SIMPLIFY!!
Forget about "convincing myself of the market" - I can sell it if its useful, gid.

collecting and mass emailing users may be too intrusive
but more importantly is harder to implement than a simpler
form of collection. Taking out collection stuff cuz its to over-featured and 
bob brought up a good point about not even wanting to divulge customer emails.

TODO:

WORKING ON: 

making adding and editing easier. 
adding getting started guide. 
public add form.

FOCUS ON PRESENTATION. 

I want people to sign up to test out the system.
In order for people to sign up they need to be thoroughly convinced
they need to be WOWED. The end-result presentation is
THE ONLY thing that will do that. prioritize the display presentation

everything else is secondary. show dont tell.
