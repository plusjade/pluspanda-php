SIMPLIFY!!
Forget about "convincing myself of the market" - I can sell it if its useful, gid.

collecting and mass emailing users may be too intrusive
but more importantly is harder to implement than a simpler
form of collection. Taking out collection stuff cuz its to over-featured and 
bob brought up a good point about not even wanting to divulge customer emails.

TODO:
* open up everything possible in order to GET HELP from developers.
* make shopify app.

WORKING ON: 

making adding and editing easier. 
adding getting started guide. 
public add form.

FOCUS ON PRESENTATION. 

I want people to sign up to test out the system.
In order for people to sign up they need to be thoroughly convinced
they need to be WOWED. The end-result presentation is
THE ONLY thing that will do that. prioritize the display presentation

everything else is secondary. show dont tell.

customer driven development.
Pluspanda is a website testimonials page/widget builder.
Provides tools to collect testimonials from your customers 
and collaborate with them quickly and easily.

Once testimonials are collected and refined, the user gets to
choose a theme and/or javascript interactions to display the testimonials
on his website.

When finished the user can export the finished output
composed of data/html, css, and javascript for use on his site.

$25.00 one time flat cost to use the service.
Unlimited exporting but is limited to 25 testimonials.


I need help with getting designers onboard to create fantastic testimonial layouts.
I can xhtml the designs even and code the javascript, but I need well designed, user-friendly testimonials layouts/interaction ideas.
Could be anything from flat lists, grids, to slideshow galleries.
