SIMPLIFY!!

collecting and mass emailing users may be too intrusive
but more importantly is harder to implement than a simpler
form of collection.

open up everything possible in order to GET HELP from developers.

make shopify app.

forget about "convincing myself of the market"
- i can sell it if its useful, gid.

taking out collection stuff cuz its to over-featured and 
bob brought up a good point about not even wanting to divulge customer emails.

- look to import from campaignmonter/mailchimp.

WORKING ON - 

making adding and editing easier. 
adding getting started guide. 
public add form.

FOCUS ON PRESENTATION. 

I want people to sign up to test out the system.
In order for people to sign up they need to be thoroughly convinced
they need to be WOWED. The end-result presentation is
THE ONLY thing that will do that. prioritize the display presentation

everything else is secondary. show dont tell.
