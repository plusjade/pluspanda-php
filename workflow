Collect Testimonials:
 
 Easily collect testimonials from your customers in 2 ways:

	1. Specify a testimonial format and customize your survey questions.
	(you don't have to customize anything, but you can!).
	2. Add new testimonial profiles into pluspanda.
	(a name and email is that is needed).
	3. Send out testimonial-requests to your profiles list.
	

 
 Automatic: (coming soon)
  Using the pluspanda api, 
	new testimonial profiles can be automatically created
	and a request sent out to your users after some 
	trigger. For example once an order is marked "delivered"
	your code can trigger pluspanda to create a profile for that customer
	and send out a followup testimonial-request email.


	(You can also manually add as many testimonials as you like within the manage tab.)
	(but that's not really "collecting" them so to speak =p )

	
Manage :

	All testimonial profiles can be managed via the manage interface.
	
	You can view which profiles have been updated (filled in).
	as well as modify each testimonial.
	
	Publish testimonials from the manage panel.
	
	
	
Display :

	Choose what type of format your testimonials should display.
	Test out the widget functionality.

	When you are happy, grab the embed code and install your testimonials.
